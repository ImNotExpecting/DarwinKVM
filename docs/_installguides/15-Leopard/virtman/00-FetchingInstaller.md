If you've already Fetched the Install Disks, continue to the next page!

To begin, you will first need to use [DarwinFetch](https://github.com/royalgraphx/DarwinFetch) to get the installer for this target release.

The XML for Virt-Manager has qemu:args that will take paths for:

``.iso``, ``.img``, ``.qcow2``, ``.cdr``, and even ``.toast`` image files!

Visit the [following section](../../../../infocenter/06-FetchingInstaller/03-PowerPC/00-Introduction/) for instructions on how to use and fetch the install files for this release. Then return once completed.

## You can now continue to the next <a href="../01-ImportingXML">page</a>.
