{: .warning }
The version of Snow Leopard for PowerPC does not officially exist, it is a manual process that involves modifying a Developer Beta of Snow Leopard to boot on PowerPC. The steps for this have not been written out, as it involves a lot of prep work before being able to see that nice Snow Leopard desktop. Wait until this warning is no longer present.
