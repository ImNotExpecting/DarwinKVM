This section is dependent on your host hardware! While we may be able to spoof things such as CPU, if you're planning to use your Front Panel or Rear Panel audio on macOS, it is subject to compatibility just as it would be on baremetal! With that being said, the first page will allow you to fetch your hardware information, then the third will help you check if it's compatible.
