DiskProvision is a Python script. It's main use in DarwinKVM is to <span style="color: #ffab52;">quickly create disk images</span> that work with QEMU. <span style="color: #ffab52;">By having the ability to format them as FAT32, mimicking USB Drives</span>, it allows us to create an OpenCore disk image for our Virtual Machine to use as an EFI partition.
