# macOS NVIDIA GPU Support Table
#### This section has been derived from various sources.

{: .warning }
This section is incomplete! While there are various supported NVIDIA GPU's that can use OCLP for readding Web Drivers, it is unstable and will not work for any practical use-cases. This section will eventually be complete, but it is so low in the priority for this guide, that consider any NVIDIA GPU not supported. While that's already true, I do understand some would like to try this anyways, and for that, I still add it here for eventual completion when I get the time.
