# Vega 10

{: .highlight }
> Vega 10 GPUs are natively supported in macOS. In this case, they do work on the latest macOS and you can proceed. 
> "The only brand of GPUs to avoid with Vega 10 is XFX. The reason is VBIOS communication issues which can't be easily solved with a reference BIOS due to how Vega's powerplay table interacts with the OS and GPU."

| Vega 56 | High Sierra (10.13) | Ventura (13) |  |
| Vega 64 | High Sierra (10.13) | Ventura (13) |  |

# Polaris 10 and 20

{: .warning }
"Regarding Polaris, basically every model of card is supported as long as itâ€™s running either a Polaris or Baffin core. Lower end cards like the RX 550 may run a Lexa core, meaning no support in macOS, the only brands you should avoid with the Polaris series would be XFX (460/560 models), PowerColor, HIS and VisionTek as many users have had bootloader and macOS boot issues". In this case, they do work on the latest macOS and you can proceed.

# Unsupported GPU's

{: .important }
While there are other GPU's that are supported up to Monterey and Big Sur, this guide focuses on the latest macOS, and unfortunately these cards below and others not mentioned, will not work in this guide without the user doing more manual modification, even as far as flashing custom VBIOS' which is out of the scope of this guide.

## Navi 2X and Navi 3X

{: .note }
While Navi 21 and Navi 23 are supported, Navi 22, Navi 24 and Navi 3X based graphic cards are not at the time of writing. No guarantee can be made for future support.
